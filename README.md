# extensions-store-mockup

Just a crude mockup of the extensions app in GNOME Shell 3.36 to show a possible online store in it. 

I used the Drawing app (https://github.com/maoschanz/drawing) to modify the screenshots with elements of the Pamac graphical package manager (https://gitlab.manjaro.org/applications/pamac) such as the search icons and bar, the headerbar tabs, extension order menu, and the general expos√© layout of extensions and their description and options.

Yes, I know I should've used the Adwaita theme but the purpose of this showcase still stands, besides I was already half way through the editing when I remembered so out of sheer laziness I'm keeping the theme (https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme) I was using which ended up helping due to its simpler design.
