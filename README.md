# extensions-store-mockup

Just a crude mockup of the extensions app in GNOME Shell 3.36 to show a possible online store in it. 

I used the Drawing app to modify the screenshots with elements of the Pamac graphical package manager (https://gitlab.manjaro.org/applications/pamac) such as the search icons and bar, the headerbar tabs, extension order menu, and the general expos√© layout of extensions and their description and options.
