# extensions-store-mockup

Just a crude mockup of the extensions app in GNOME Shell 3.36 to show a possible online store in it. 

I used the Drawing app (https://github.com/maoschanz/drawing) to modify the screenshots with elements of the Pamac graphical package manager (https://gitlab.manjaro.org/applications/pamac) such as the search icons and bar, the headerbar tabs, extension order menu, and the general expos√© layout of extensions and their description and options.

Yes, I know I should've used the Adwaita theme but the purpose of this showcase still stands, besides I was already half way through the editing when I remembered so out of sheer laziness I'm keeping the theme (https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme) I was using which ended up helping due to its simpler design.

As you can see, there are some weird rendering glitches due to Drawing, I'll be sure to notify them.

Again, couple glitches, don't look at them, focus on the big picture.
